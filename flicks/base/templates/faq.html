    <p>
    {% trans %}
      Firefox Flicks is a global video competition encouraging filmmakers to educate 
      people about the issues that affect our online lives. This year, we're focusing 
      on the power that having access to the Web through mobile devices gives 
      people and how that power can change the way you see the world and the way 
      you function within it.
    {% endtrans %}

    {% trans link_brief=settings.LINK_BRIEF[request.locale] %}
      With that in mind, the 2013 Firefox Flicks theme is "Get Mobilized."
